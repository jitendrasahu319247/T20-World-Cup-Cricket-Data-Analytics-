Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.

        "description": "Ebadat Hossain Chowdhury's journey from being a volleyball player for Bangladesh Air Force to becoming a Test cricketer in February 2019 was a short, and interesting, one. Living in their barracks, Ebadat dreamt of bowling like Brett Lee one day. His dream came true when he took part in the 2016 Robi Pacer Hunt in Faridpur, crisscrossing 342km southwest from his hometown Sylhet. He was one of the top three bowlers, and was duly picked by the scouts to a training camp in Dhaka."

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "

        "description": "A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career."

Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016.

        "description": "A left-arm spinner from Northwood Boys High, the alma mater of Shaun Pollock, Keshav Maharaj emerged at a time when South Africa began to take spin seriously. For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africa's first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer."

A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009. Naturally athletic, he had represented his home province of Manicaland in 200 and 400 metre events while in high school and soon found his calling in cricket."

From a sporting family - his father was a goalkeeper at a decent level and his brother plays rugby and represented Ireland at cricket at age-group level - Adair also showed promise in rugby but committed to cricket having been offered a trial by Warwickshire in 2013. He has represented Ireland at age-group and A team level and claimed the wicket of Marcus Trescothick as his maiden victim in first-class cricket. He was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2017 season and has since played for Northern Knights and Durham's second team.\n\nGeorge Dobell"

With Denesh Ramdin representing West Indies in all three formats, and Andre Fletcher also in the limited-overs mix, West Indies have used Charles' second skill sparingly."

        "description": "Michael Leask is an explosive batsman from Aberdeen. He showed as much when he smeared five sixes during a memorable 16-ball 42 in an ODI against England in May 2014. But he has been hampered by inconsistency, and he only mustered 56 runs at an average of 9.33 during the World Cup Qualifiers in 2014. Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.\nLeask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a \"feisty cricketer\". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "

He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.\n\nESPNcricinfo staff"

That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "
